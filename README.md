# antispoofing

Face recognition systems are becoming more prevalent than ever. From face recognition on your iPhone/smartphone, to face recognition for mass surveillance in China, face recognition systems are being utilized everywhere.

However, face recognition systems are easily fooled by “spoofing” and “non-real” faces.

Face recognition systems can be circumvented simply by holding up a photo of a person called spoof (whether printed, on a smartphone, etc.) to the face recognition camera. Liveness models are intelligent models that seek to differentiate between a real image and a spoof image.

Our dataset consists of images genearated from portrait recording of various individuals and spoof images generated by recording the screen of the of the desktop as the video is played. Our model is a classification model  that is able to detect such fake/spoof images.
